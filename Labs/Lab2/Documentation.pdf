A hash table is a practical and efficient data structure for managing symbols in a
compiler's symbol table, offering fast and reliable lookup, insertion, and scalability
to accommodate the needs of various programming languages and source code complexities.

The SymTable has as attributes the size and the HashTable.
It also has a method "put" that adds a key in the SymTable
if the key doesn't exist and returns the position of the key,
if the key already exists, it only returns the position.
